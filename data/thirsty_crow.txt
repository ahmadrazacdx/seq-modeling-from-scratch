Once upon a time, on a very hot day, a thirsty crow was flying in search of water. The sun was shining brightly, and the poor crow was feeling tired and weak.
After flying for a long time, the crow finally saw a pitcher lying under a tree. He quickly flew down and looked inside. There was a little water at the bottom, but his beak could not reach it.
The crow thought for a moment. Then he got an idea!
He started picking up small pebbles one by one and dropped them into the pitcher. Slowly, the water began to rise. The crow continued dropping stones until the water came up high enough.
At last, the crow could drink the water.
He felt refreshed and flew away happily.
