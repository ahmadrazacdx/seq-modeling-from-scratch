the crow was thirsty .
a bird was very dry .
the black crow needed water .
he flew searching for water .
the bird looked for a drink .
he found a pitcher .
the crow saw a pot .
he found a tall jar .
there was little water .
the water level was low .
the water was at the bottom .
he could not reach the water .
his beak was too short .
the bird could not drink .
he tried to break the pot .
the crow tried to overturn the jar .
it was too heavy .
the pot did not move .
he saw some pebbles .
the crow found some stones .
he saw rocks nearby .
he picked up a pebble .
the bird took a stone .
he dropped it into the pitcher .
he put the stone in the pot .
he threw pebbles inside .
one by one he dropped them .
the crow worked hard .
the water began to rise .
the water level went up .
the water came to the top .
he drank the water .
the crow quenched his thirst .
the bird drank happily .
he flew away .
the crow flew back home .
the bird was happy .
